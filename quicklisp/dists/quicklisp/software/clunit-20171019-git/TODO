CLUnit TODO
===========
	"There are two ways of constructing a software design.
	 One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously
	 no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so
	 complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."
	  — C.A.R. Hoare.
	
	"Programming is like sex: one mistake and you're providing
	 support for a lifetime."

1.	Performance
	The library seems to suffer from a serious performance hit.
	Try the following piece of code to amuse yourself.
	
		(deftest test-true ()
			(assert-true t))

		(time
			(loop
				:for i :from 1 :upto 1000
				:do (run-test 'test-true :report-progress nil)))
		
	There are two possible culprits that I suspect:
	1.	Inorder to allow you redefine your macros and functions without
		having to redefine the tests, the library delays evaluation
		of the test forms to runtime. This evalution occurs everytime
		you run a test.
		
		I think this is an extremely valuable feature so sacrificing it
		in exchange for a little more speed does not really seem like a
		sensible thing to do.
		
	Only with feedback from the community can we make a decision whether
	this is such a serious shortcoming that needs to be addressed.
	The unit test framework provides so much more to make up for its
	performance, so maybe its something we might be willing to live with,
	at least for now.
